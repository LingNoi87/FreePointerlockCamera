 #### Information 
 FreePointerFlyControls.js is a small but essential adaptation of the original base library "PointerLockFlyControl.js". Now the camera can be moved in the same manner as in first person shooters.
 Motivation was to remove continuous panning, tilting once mouse has been displaced from "view center point". Rotation and translation is allowed in all axis and directions.
